<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The purpose of this vocabulary is to provide the definitions of the structures of the different data cubes for greenhouse gas emissions. For this, the W3C Data Cube vocabulary is reused and instances have been generated for each structure in order to indicate the dimensions and measurements used in each of the cubes. Additionally, several vocabularies and code lists are reused to describe the details of the gas emitters and their different sectors.</span>
